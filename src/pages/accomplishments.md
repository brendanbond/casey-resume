During my time at Accenture and Meta, I spearheaded the development framework for tiered escalation flows, which has proven to be a game changer in our operations. This framework spans from customer facing roles in Tier 1 to more complex deep dive analysis in Tier 3.

At Tier 2, my team provided technical support on the backend by investigating payout failures and working closely with clients to detect common anomalies to flag to the Tier 3 team. As we moved up to Tier 3, we conducted more extensive analysis on widespread issues such as payment audits for over 2000 customers. 

This accomplishment had a significant impact on our operations, leading to improved customer satisfaction and increased efficiency in our processes. By creating a framework for existing flows where quality assurance was not currently present, we were able to improve our workflows and provide a higher quality service to our clients. Overall, this experience has honed my analytical and problem-solving skills, which I believe will be valuable assets in any future role.
