As a native of Austin, Texas, I have deep roots in the community and a strong understanding of its culture and values. Growing up in Austin has given me a unique perspective and appreciation for the city's vibrant and diverse community. This background has also allowed me to develop strong communication skills, which I have leveraged in my various professional roles.

Through my previous positions, I have utilized my skills in social media marketing and videography to create engaging content that resonates with audiences. My work at Sail & Ski led me to start my own company where I was able to showcase my abilities in directing, editing, and producing published content on various social media platforms.


Working at  Accenture through a contract with Meta has given me exposure to a wide range of industries and clients. My experience, combined with my strong organizational and project management skills, has enabled me to successfully manage complex projects and collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams.
